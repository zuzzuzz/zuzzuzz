- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zuzzuzz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a career and talent development expert with a background in adult learning and motivation.  I have experience building professional teams as a recruiter and project manager across multiple industries from nonprofits, education, to Big Tech. I once heard someone say the definition of happiness is "the joy you feel in pursuit of your ultimate potential." This has had a profound meaning to how I approach work and life. My goal is to help others learn skills and strategies to have a successful career.

- ðŸŒ± I learn so that I can teach.
